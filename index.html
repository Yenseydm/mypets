    <p> BUTTERS: Butters, my mini pin, is my oldest pet. She is about 5-6 years old. She is very needy and wants so much attention.
        She loves to wear clothes, it's pretty funny. For a small dog she runs really fast and sometimes even chases after deer.

    <p> CRUNCHY: My white and black cat adopted himself into my family. 
        I was walking one day with my dog Butters and he started to play with her. He followed us home and he is still here.
        I don't know his bday but he should be around 3-4 years old.
