   <h2> BUTTERS</h2> <img src="images/butters.jpg" alt="Butters" >
    <p class="bio"> Butters, my mini pin, is my oldest pet. She is about 5-6 years old. She is very needy and wants so much attention.
        She loves to wear clothes, it's pretty funny. For a small dog she runs really fast and sometimes even chases after deer.

    <h2> BONES</h2> <img src="images/bones.jpg" alt="Bones"> 
    <p class="bio"> Bones is the most common cat that you can think of. He is very very lazy, hence Lazy Bones. However he is kind of link a dog in the sence that he 
        loves belly rubs and sits when I give him a treat. He is the most loving cat you can think of and also doesn't care about anything. </p>

<section>
    <h2> NOODLES</h2> <img src="images/noodles.jpg" alt="Noodles"> 
     <p class="bio"> Noodles honestly just came out of no where. My back story for her, from what I say basically goes like this... Bones has babies with some random cat and the 
         mother cat just dumped Noodles on him like " here's your child, not my problem " and I never saw what I assume was the mom again. She has grown really close to Bones 
         though and they love sleeping bundled up together.
